Long time no see! As we had expected, stronger mobility restrictions were imposed in most regions while we were in Andalucía, so by the time we went back to Marti’s hometown for the Christmas break, we had to stay within the limits of that region until May 9th, 2021. We decided to spend this larger stretch of time in Panticosa, a small town in the Aragonese Pyrenees where Marti has been going skiing since she was a child. 


Panticosa is part of the [Tena Valley](https://www.valledetena.com/en/conocer-el-valle), famous for its numerous 3000m peaks, and beautiful lakes and forests. This year was packed with snow, and with most ski resorts closed for the season, we spent our time hiking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. 


Project wise, Marti implemented the evaluation of the third cohort of MUVA [Assistentes](https://muvamoz.co.mz/muva-assistentes/?lang=en), a project which aims to promote the economic empowerment of young Mozambican women by giving them a first professional experience in the labour market as teacher assistants. Andres worked on providing recommendations to the monitoring indicators and data management system of the [NDC Partnership](https://ndcpartnership.org/), which supports countries around the world to meet the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
