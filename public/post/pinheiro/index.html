<p>A bit of a background here! Back in 2017, we were honoured to become part of the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning team for <a href="https://muvamoz.co.mz/?lang=en">MUVA</a>, an innovative programme aimed to improve access to the labour market for young women in Mozambique. The nature of the work in this project is extremely collaborative and requires constant communication with the local team (+ super fun trips to Maputo!), so improving our Portuguese has always been the goal. This is why when the road trip idea started to take shape, we thought we could use the opportunity to really polish those ‘portuñol’ skills.</p>
<p>Portugal did extremely well in keeping COVID-19 under control, so they were particularly cautious about opening the border with Spain. We contacted the Embassy to get informed about safety rules for upcoming visitors, and made sure we were all in good shape for the next stage. Early July, we made it to beautiful Pinheiro.</p>
<p>Our time there gravitated around some key daily moments: i) fresh corn bread delivered home by home at 10.00am, ii) same procedure for fresh sardines at 12.00pm, and iii) quick visit to the local pond after work. We are not quite sure how much we improved our Portuguese, but our neighbours are still probably laughing at our random attempts to start a conversation.</p>
<p>Speaking of MUVA, this is probably the best place to congratulate the team for successfully organizing the annual Programme Reflection Week online, and with more than 20 attendees across three continents. A big shout as well to the Analytics Team at the <a href="https://gmdac.iom.int/">International Organization for Migration</a>, which Andrés is part of, for finalizing their study on the inclusion of Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Latin America.</p>
