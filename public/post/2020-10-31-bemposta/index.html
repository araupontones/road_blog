<p>Before deciding where to go next, we mapped the places we had visited so far and realized that geographically, the route had been a little hectic. Aiming to amend this while ‘chasing the sun’ for a few more months, we headed for the Algarve, which would be our first stop on our southern route.</p>
<p>Some friends had already raved about the area, and they were not wrong. An average temperature of 19 °C during the day and clear water (and dog friendly!) beaches felt like a dream in October. We particularly liked the far west side of the region, which is less developed urbanistically, and secluded quiet coves can be found wild among cliffs and dunes.</p>
<p>Workwise, this stage was all about surveys. Andrés started the implementation of the third round of the <a href="https://muvamoz.co.mz/research/?lang=en"><em>Urban Youth Survey</em></a>, which aims to generate a profile of young women living in urban areas in Mozambique. Andrés is particularly excited about this round because he has combined <em>Survey Solutions</em>’ API with <em>R-Shiny</em> to create an online, real-time dashboard to quality assure the data as it is being collected. This will help field managers and enumerators on their daily work, and it will enable the leading organisation, <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/">UN-WIDER</a>, to monitor how fieldwork is going at any time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Marti got started with the fieldwork phase (remotely this time!) for the mixed-methods evaluation of a COVID-19 Cash Transfer programme in informal settlements in Kenya. The study aims to understand the impact of the pandemic on households’ nutrition levels, access to
health services, and the use of negative coping strategies, as well as to assess whether this emergency response cash transfer may have an effect on those variables.</p>
