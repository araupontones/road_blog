A bit of a background here! Back in 2017, we were honoured to become part of the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning team for MUVA, an innovative programme aimed to improve access to the labour market for young women in Mozambique.

      <description>The story of how two development economists based out of Madrid reconsider their priorities after living under strict lockdown for almost 100 days in a rural area in northern Spain. An attempt to make the so-called ‘nomad’ lifestyle work while calculating standard errors, ggplotting, and ultimately promoting evidence-based policymaking.
