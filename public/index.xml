      <description>And May 9th came along, and with it, the end of the State of Alarm. Cross-region mobility was restored, and we decided to continue with the original south –&amp;gt; east route, which we had to stop when we were in Andalucía. On May 9th, 2021, we entered Menorca by ferry.
Menorca is a 47km long island located in the Mediterranean Sea that belongs to the Balearic Islands archipelago. It is a quiet and relaxed place, even more so now that national and international tourism has been barely restored.</description>

      <description>Long time no see! As we had expected, stronger mobility restrictions were imposed in most regions while we were in Andalucía, so by the time we went back to Marti’s hometown for the Christmas break, we had to stay within the limits of that region until May 9th, 2021. We decided to spend this larger stretch of time in Panticosa, a small town in the Aragonese Pyrenees where Marti has been going skiing since she was a child.</description>

      <description>Population: 73 inhabitants
Confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain when we got there: 1,420,432
As shown in the graph below, the number of Covid-19 cases increased sharply during the month of October, and most Spanish regions decided to establish some sort of mobility restrictions as a response. Guessing that this could probably be our last stop before the Christmas break, we moved to Hortichuelas Bajas, Almería, on November 6th, 2020.</description>

Just a few days into our Algarve stage, Portugal declared what is known as ‘State of Calamity’, prompted by the steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. A similar direction was hinted by Spain, where talks about new upcoming lockdown measures started to spread quickly. Wanting to make sure we made it back into the country before getting ‘stuck’ on the other side of the border, we headed to Caños de Meca, Cádiz, on October 25th, 2020.</description>

      <description>Population: 5 inhabitants
Confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain when we got there: 861,112
Before deciding where to go next, we mapped the places we had visited so far and realized that geographically, the route had been a little hectic. Aiming to amend this while ‘chasing the sun’ for a few more months, we headed for the Algarve, which would be our first stop on our southern route.</description>

Something that COVID-19 did not change is the fact that September is a month of change. It means the end of summer holidays and the return to work and/or school. For Marti’s sister, who is a Social Educator (you can check out her profile here), this meant the start of her Master in Intervention with Vulnerable Groups at Risk of Exclusion at the University of Deusto in Donostia.</description>

      <description>Population: 7 inhabitants
Confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain when we got there: 250,545
A bit of a background here! Back in 2017, we were honoured to become part of the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning team for MUVA, an innovative programme aimed to improve access to the labour market for young women in Mozambique. The nature of the work in this project is extremely collaborative and requires constant communication with the local team (+ super fun trips to Maputo!</description>

  Knowing that the months ahead were packed with work-related travel, Marti was clear about her birthday present this year: a two-day skiing trip close to her home town and a birthday dinner with friends to close it off. We hit the slopes on March 11th, right when the debate about COVID-19 seemed to start heating up.</description>

      <description>The story of how two development economists based out of Madrid reconsider their priorities after living under strict lockdown for almost 100 days in a rural area in northern Spain. Trying to adapt to this new COVID-19 world, and exclusively visiting low densely populated areas where social distancing can be guaranteed and maximized, this is an attempt to make the so-called ‘nomad’ lifestyle work while calculating standard errors, ggplotting, and ultimately promoting evidence-based policymaking.</description>
