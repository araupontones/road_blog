<p>Before deciding where to go next, we mapped the places we had visited so far and realized that geographically, the route had been a little hectic. Aiming to amend this while ‘chasing the sun’ for a few more months, we headed for the Algarve, which would be our first stop on our southern route.
Some friends had already raved about the area, and they were not wrong. An average temperature of 19 °C during the day and clear water (and dog friendly!) beaches felt like a dream in October. We particularly liked the far west side of the region, which is less developed urbanistically, and secluded quiet coves can be found wild among cliffs and dunes.</p>
