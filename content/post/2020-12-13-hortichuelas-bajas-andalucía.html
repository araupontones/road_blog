</ul>
<p>As shown in the graph below, the number of Covid-19 cases increased sharply during the month of October, and most Spanish regions decided to establish some sort of mobility restrictions as a response. Guessing that this could probably be our last stop before the Christmas break, we moved to Hortichuelas Bajas, Almería, on November 6th, 2020.</p>
<p>This small town is situated within the natural park of Cabo de Gata, a natural reserve of volcanic origin which is the largest protected ecological area of the Mediterranean Sea. Still aloof from the vast urban development that has taken place in other areas of the Spanish coast, the park offers incredible walks along the rugged coastline, where we enjoyed the intense blue waters and the visit to old windmills and numerous defensive batteries which once served to protect the region from the attacks of pirates.</p>
<p>While in Almería, Marti started preparing the endline phase of an impact evaluation of an Early Childhood Education project in Liberia. The evaluation is funded by the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/brief/early-learning-partnership">Early Learning Partnership</a>, a multidonor trust fund managed by the World Bank, and it is aimed to assess the impact of an innovative teacher training on children’s numeracy and literacy outcomes. Andrés finalized the third round of the <a href="https://muvamoz.co.mz/research/?lang=en"><em>Urban Youth Survey</em></a> in urban areas of Mozambique and worked on a blog post with <a href="https://gmdac.iom.int/">IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Center</a> which aims to explore the potential of using Big Data to measure the intent to migrate and better ways to predict migration flows. The blog is expected to be published early in 2021.</p>
