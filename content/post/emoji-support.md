Knowing that the months ahead were packed with work-related travel, Marti was clear about her birthday present this year: a two-day skiing trip close to her home town and a birthday dinner with friends to close it off. We hit the slopes on March 11th, right when the debate about COVID-19 seemed to start heating up. Two days later, the ski resort was forced to close. We made to it to her family’s place, but decided to keep the celebration to the close ones at home. On March 14th, an strict lockdown of initially 15 days was announced.

A decision had to be made: should we rush into Madrid before the state of alarm officially began, or should we just wait 15 days and get back home afterwards? Given the lower population density and the size of open green space around Uncastillo, we understood an strict confinement would be easier there. So we stayed. And 15 days turned into 100. 

During this time, work kept us extremely busy. May was the deadline to deliver the first Evaluation Report for <a href="https://www.ukpact.co.uk/">UK PACT</a> and the whole team was working around the clock. All the related in-country missions had been cancelled and replaced with <i>Microsoft Teams</i>-based meetings. Stakeholders were trained remotely, and primary data collected over the phone and consistenly entered into our online <a href="https://www.ukpactmel.com/">Results Management System</a>. We also worked on finalising the evaluation of the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>'s Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology for Asia and the Pacific. 

These months also helped Marti in her quest to get Andrés into Ashtanga Yoga, and walking Silvio in the mountains became the most precious moment of the day. And little by little we ended up realising that getting back to the urban scene did not make sense just yet. We cancelled the rent of our flat in Madrid, packed up, and started a road trip that does not have an end date for now.

It was winter when the strict lockdown began.

More than 100 days later we were in the middle of spring...

Thus, we decided to terminate our lease in Madrid and to start a nomad life until things get back to normal!
