<p>Something that COVID-19 did not change is the fact that September is a month of change. It means the end of summer holidays and the return to work and/or school. For Marti’s sister, who is a Social Educator (you can check out her profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-garcia-aisa-296b7315a/?originalSubdomain=es">here</a>), this meant the start of her Master in Intervention with Vulnerable Groups at Risk of Exclusion at the University of Deusto in Donostia. Marti has always been a fan of the Basque Country, so we took advantage of the situation and decided to hang around the area for a while. This is how we made it to Etorraberri, a typical vasque <em>caserío</em> in the valley of Sastarrain.</p>
<p>We were extremely lucky with the weather overall, which allowed us to fully enjoy the mountain-beach combo that characterizes the region so well. One of the highlights of these weeks was the walk Zumaia-Deba, which is a breathtaking hike that connects both towns through the Flysch cliffs along the coast. Although thinking it well, if you asked Silvio, he would probably say the icing of the cake was the fact that the <em>caserío</em> where we were staying was surrounded by all the farm animals you can think of (also sure they thought very differently of Silvio).</p>
<p>September was also a month of change for Marti, who put an end to her work as MEL Specialist for the <a href="https://www.policyfellowship.org/">Oxford Policy Fellowship</a>, a programme which connects ministries in developing countries with early-career legal and public policy advisors, in order to build local capacity in the long term and provide immediate gap filling. Meanwhile, Andrés created an online financial tracking system for <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/afr/news/press/2018/9/5b9fabe84/uganda-launches-new-education-response-plan-for-africas-biggest-refugee.html">Uganda´s Education Response Plan</a>, in order to support the initiative to better monitor its spending.</p>

<p>Our neighbors were farmers owning horses, cows, chickens (it was not so easy for Silvio to behave during the daily walks..)</p>
